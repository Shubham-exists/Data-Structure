# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains my personal notes and solutions to various LeetCode problems, focusing on fundamental **Data Structures**. The goal is to practice problem-solving, improve coding skills, and document my learning process along the way. Each problem solution will be accompanied by a well-documented note for future reference and revision.

## Overview

This repository contains:
1. **LeetCode Solutions**: Organized by problem categories and data structures.
2. **Data Structure Notes**: Key concepts, algorithms, and tips related to each data structure.

Each problem is documented with a brief problem statement, an approach to the solution, and a well-commented code. This helps me to keep track of how I solve problems and serves as a revision guide for later.
