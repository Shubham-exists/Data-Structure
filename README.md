# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains my personal notes and solutions to various LeetCode problems, focusing on fundamental **Data Structures**. The goal is to practice problem-solving, improve coding skills, and document my learning process along the way. Each problem solution will be accompanied by a well-documented note for future reference and revision.

## Overview

This repository contains:
1. **LeetCode Solutions**: Organized by problem categories and data structures.
2. **Data Structure Notes**: Key concepts, algorithms, and tips related to each data structure.

Each problem is documented with a brief p├── Arrays/
│ ├── TwoSum.md
│ ├── MaximumSubarray.md
│ └── ...
├── LinkedList/
│ ├── ReverseLinkedList.md
│ └── ...
├── Stack/
│ ├── ValidParentheses.md
│ └── ...
├── Queue/
├── Trees/roblem statement, an approach to the solution, and a well-commented code. This helps me to keep track of how I solve problems and serves as a revision guide for later.

## Repository Structure


- Each folder represents a **Data Structure** category.
- Inside each folder: Markdown files for problems and their solutions.
- `Notes/`: Contains conceptual notes and visual explanations.
- `README.md`: Project overview and navigation.
  


## How to Use

1. **Browse by topic**  
   Navigate to the folder of the data structure you're interested in (e.g., `Arrays/`, `Trees/`).

2. **Read the notes**  
   Go through `Notes/` to build conceptual understanding.

3. **Practice problems**  
   Read through problem solutions with explanations and try solving them yourself.

4. **Track your progress**  
   Fork the repo and maintain your own notes alongside!
